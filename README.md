# Contribution for tee_tee_os_framework #

tee_os_framework mainly contains the framework codes of tee, which is responsible for the management of the whole life cycle of TA, the processing of CA and TA interactive information and the management of drivers. In addition, it also provides core services such as encryption, decryption and secure storage. The specific module introduction is as followed.
