@brief This macro is used for power management. Use it upon entry to system-on-chip suspended state,
to perform secure backup of on-chip secure RAM to an off-chip DRAM.
This backed-up data is encrypted and signed with the session key.
The backup must be coupled with a matching restore operation upon wakeup from suspended state.
Restoring must be done to the exact same address that was backed up, with the exact same size that was backed up.
\note  The session key must be initialized prior to using this API.\par
\note The backup destination buffer should be 16 bytes bigger than the source buffer, in order to accommodate the signature.

@return CC_OK	On success.
@return A non-zero value from cc_util_error.h on failure.

@brief This macro is used for power management. Use it upon wakeup from suspended state,
to restore the data that was backed up upon entry to suspended state.
The source buffer is decrypted and verified with the session key.
The restore operation must match a previous backup operation.
Restoring must be done to the exact same address and with the exact same size that was previously backed up.
\note The session key cannot be replaced between matching backup and restore operations. \par
\note In case FIPS certification support is set to ON, this function is also responsible to deliver the TEE FIPS status to the REE
(after waking up from suspended state).

@return CC_OK	On success.
@return A non-zero value from cc_util_error.h on failure.
