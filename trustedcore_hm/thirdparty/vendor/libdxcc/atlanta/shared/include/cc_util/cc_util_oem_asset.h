 * @brief This API provides a means of secure provisioning of OEM assets to devices using ARM TrustZone CryptoCell TEE.
 *        It takes an encrypted and authenticated asset package produced by the OEM Asset Packing offline utility
 *        (using AES-CCM with key derived from KOEM and the asset identifier), authenticates and decrypts it.
 *        The decrypted asset data, and optional user data parameter, are returned to the caller.
 * \note  The device must be in Secure LCS, otherwise error is returned.
 *
 * @return CC_UTIL_OK on success.
 * @return A non-zero value on failure as defined in cc_util_error.h.
