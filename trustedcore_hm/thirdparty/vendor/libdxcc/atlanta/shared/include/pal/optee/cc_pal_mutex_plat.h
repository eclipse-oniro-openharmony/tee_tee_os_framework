/**
* @brief File Description:
*        This file contains functions for resource management (semaphor operations).
*        The functions implementations are generally just wrappers to different operating system calls.
*        None of the described functions will check the input parameters so the behavior
*        of the APIs in illegal parameters case is dependent on the operating system behavior.
